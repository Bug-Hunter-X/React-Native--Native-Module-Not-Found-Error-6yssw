To fix this issue, you should ensure your native modules are correctly linked. Here's how:

1. **Verify Linking:** Double-check that you've followed all the linking instructions provided by the third-party library's documentation. This usually involves running specific commands (often using `react-native link`).
2. **Check Project Configuration:** Examine your project's configuration files, such as `android/app/build.gradle` and `ios/Podfile`, to ensure that the native module is correctly included and configured. Verify that all required dependencies are listed and the paths are accurate.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, cached files can cause problems. Cleaning and rebuilding your project can resolve issues related to native module linking. In Android Studio, you can use the "Clean Project" and "Rebuild Project" options. In Xcode, clean the project, and then rebuild it. 
4. **Check Package.json:** Check for any version conflicts or inconsistencies in your `package.json` file related to the problematic native module or dependent packages. Consider updating or reinstalling the packages if needed to eliminate potential compatibility issues.
5. **Update React Native and Libraries:** Ensure your React Native version and the third-party library are compatible. Updating both can often resolve unexpected issues and compatibility problems with native modules.  You may consider checking the compatibility matrix provided by the third-party library. 
6. **Examine the library's documentation:** Verify that the library you are using includes the correct native modules for both Android and iOS.  
7. **Check for other errors:** Investigate and troubleshoot any other errors that might be caused by the problematic native module.  Check the error logs carefully to determine if any other errors or issues exist in your project that might be interfering with the native module.  

If the problem persists, it's best to consult the third-party library's documentation, search for similar issues on GitHub, or seek assistance in a React Native community forum.
